## What Does the App Do

**This app can be used to predict what a user will say next**

**Takes input (text string) from a user and uses an algorithm choose the next most likely word the user will say**

- App can improve typing speed 
- Improved spelling and word accuracy

---

## The Process

*1. Randomly sample corpus: Choose any number of lines to read from each corpus and combine to one large text file*

*2. Clean and Process Data: Involves removing punctuation, curse words, misspellings, and creating tokens of each string*

*3. Create n-grams: Process is to combine groups of words together to form spoken phrases*

*4. Clean-up n-grams and write: Remove all low frequency ngrams and write file to csv to dramatically decrease size*

*5. Seperate n-grams: Seperate each of the n-gram tables so each string is in it's own column in the data frame*

*6. Algorithm: Create algorithm to look into column for matching text then return last word, and back-off when no match is found*

## The Prediction

**The Prediction works by:**

- Using input string to lookup n-gram combination

- Looks first at 4gram model to find a text match

- Try to match combination of input and gram string

- if no match is found looks at trigram, bigram, and unigram

- If no matches are found returns most common word

## How to use App:

- app can accessed here

- wait about 20 seconds for data to load

- just start start typing text in the input field

- most likely word will appear after evry input
